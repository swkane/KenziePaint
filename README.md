This is the start of a very simple Paint program.
The "fill" tool is not complete yet; so far it only colors the pixel clicked on.
You must finish implementing the fill() method in fill.js so that it fills in an
entire connected region of like-colored pixels.
The comments in the method describe the algorithm in pseudo-code. Your task is
to implement it in Javascript.
